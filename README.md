# eigenda-exex

An execution extension for interfacing with EigenDA.
The reth node listens to EigenDA batch events, and starts downloading all the blobs in the batch.

This is useful for fraud proofs, rollup nodes, etc...

For running this in a testing environment, please see [here](/testutils/README.md).
